To change the file format for your assembler project, I suggest a new structure for the project files while maintaining the key features and instructions. Here's an updated version of the structure along with explanations for each file/folder:

### üõ†Ô∏è **Assembler for Custom Instruction Set**  
### üìú **Overview**  
This assembler is designed to convert assembly language instructions into machine code for a custom instruction set architecture (ISA). It simplifies the process of program development by automating the translation of human-readable mnemonics into binary code that can be executed by the target system. The project incorporates various features such as opcode mapping, label resolution, error detection, and machine code generation.

### ‚ú® **Key Features**  
- **Instruction Parsing**: Efficiently reads and interprets assembly instructions line by line, ensuring adherence to the syntax of the custom ISA.
- **Opcode Mapping**: Translates mnemonics into their corresponding binary opcodes, based on the predefined mapping table.
- **Label Resolution**: Automatically resolves symbolic labels into memory addresses, enabling jump instructions to function correctly.
- **Machine Code Generation**: Produces optimized binary machine code ready for execution on the target hardware or emulator.
- **Error Detection**: Provides robust error handling, detecting syntax issues, undefined labels, and other common programming mistakes.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular code structure facilitates easy extension for additional instructions or new features.

### üîß **Prerequisites**  
To run this assembler, ensure the following:
- **Python Version**: Python 3.6 or higher.
- **Dependencies**: Install the required libraries via `requirements.txt` (if applicable).

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### üöÄ **How to Use**  
#### Step 1: Clone the Repository  
Begin by downloading the source code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/assembler
cd assembler
```

#### Step 2: Prepare Input File  
Write your assembly program in a text file with a `.asm` extension. Use mnemonics and labels as per the supported instruction set.

#### Step 3: Run the Assembler  
Execute the assembler using the following command:
```bash
python main.py input_file.asm output_file.bin
```
Replace `input_file.asm` with the path to your assembly file and `output_file.bin` with the desired output file name.

#### Step 4: Verify the Output  
The generated machine code will be saved in `output_file.bin`. This file can be loaded into the target system or emulator.

### üìú **Supported Instructions**

The assembler supports the following instructions:

| Mnemonic | Binary Opcode | Description | Example |
|----------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| ADD      | 0001          | Adds values from two registers and stores the result in a register. | ADD R1, R2, R3 |
| SUB      | 0010          | Subtracts one register's value from another. | SUB R1, R2, R3 |
| LOAD     | 0100          | Loads data from memory into a register. | LOAD R1, 0x04 |
| STORE    | 0101          | Stores register data into a memory location. | STORE R1, 0x04 |
| JMP      | 0110          | Jumps to a specified label in the program. | JMP LOOP |

### üß™ **Testing**  
The project includes test cases to validate its functionality. To run the tests:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Use the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```
The test cases compare the assembler's output with expected binary files to ensure accuracy.

### üîç **Error Handling and Debugging**  
The assembler includes mechanisms to handle common errors:
- **Invalid Syntax**: Reports the line number and type of syntax error.
- **Undefined Labels**: Displays an error if a label is used but not defined in the program.
- **Invalid Instructions**: Warns if an instruction does not match the supported set.

### üõ† **Extending the Assembler**  
You can extend the assembler to support new instructions or features:
- **Add New Opcodes**: Update the `opcode_mapping` dictionary in `utils/opcode_mapping.py`.
- **Enhance Error Handling**: Modify the error-checking logic in `assembler.py`.
- **Introduce New Features**: Add functionalities like macros, conditional assembly, or pseudo-instructions.
